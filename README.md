This is a cloud storage Project(just simulating your external hdd or laptop connected through lan as cloud).
for this project to work :
1) you need xampp server.
2) you need to create the database with the name login_database ,in mysql(xampp) by copying the text in database_structure.txt .
3) you need to edit the php.ini and sendmail file inside xampp folder.
